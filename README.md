There are two code files in this submission, GameHuman.py and GameAI.py.         	
       
GameHuman.py	    
GameHuman.py is used to implement the result of AI vs Human games (you should run this script to play the game).

	1) Initialize the game (number of human players, computer players, name and difficulty). The game works best for 3 players in total.     
 	2) Play card by the indexes of the card	       
	3) Press Enter once after the computer’s turn to get information. Enter “cheat” or (“chaet” and “chat” -  common mistake typing “cheat”) if you want to accuse. Press Enter if you want to continue the game.	      
	4) Enjoy the game.
	
					       
GameAI.py	      
GameAI.py is used to implement the result of AI vs AI games. In this script, the code will show whether the AI is truly lying or not [lying?: False] or [lying?: True]
